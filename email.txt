Hi Lauren!

I’m reaching out about my interview scheduled for tomorrow, May 15th.

During our last call, I remember you stressed the importance of prep for each round of the Facebook interview.

When we scheduled my interview, I began prepping immediately, anticipating that, with the current project I was on at my current job winding down, I would have a few weeks on the “beach” to focus on the prep. Circumstances changed and I was put on an intense new project with a government client. Between this new client and the consulting job I am working at night, I have not had the time to prep as I would have liked.

While I am confident in my overall coding skillset as well as my leadership and interpersonal skills, I am not as prepared for the technical aspect of this interview as I had hoped to be.

While I am happy to proceed with the interview, I value the interviewer’s time. Accordingly, I would consider pushing this interview a few weeks when I foresee my schedule loosening up and providing more time to prepare.

Of course, if you'd rather cancel I defer to your preference.
